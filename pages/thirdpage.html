    <h3>
    CSS
    </h3>
    <p>
    When I first saw CSS, it seemed too difficult. When anybody is new in the field, they have a lot of difficulties, which is natural. I was confused about the different CSS properties, such as what they do and what the benefits of using CSS properties are. My nine research proprieties are animation, background, border, color, dimension, font, text, transform, and visual formatting. After my research, I want to know and understand the CSS properties better and in an easier way so that I can explore them more efficiently.

    <h3>
    Color
    </h3>
    <p>The color property explains how you want to use the color of the text. We can use any color as a background color, and a text color that makes it look beautiful and easy to read. Its function is decorating the text and the background color. CS's color value are used in Hexadecimal colors, RGB colors, RGBA colors, HSL colors, HSLA colors, and Predefined cross-browser color names.
    </p>
    <h3>
    Box Model
    </h3>
    <p>All HTML elements use boxes. When you talk about CSS, it means you're talking about design and layout. The value of the box model is content and padding, border, and margin. When you're working with CSS elements, it means you have set the width and height of the properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Font families</h3>
    <p>There are two types of font families. There are generic family and font family. A group of font family that look similar are Serif or Monospace. And some of the specific font family are Times New Roman or Arial. There are two font size values: absolute, or relative size.
