          The best way to get familiar with the project is to read the repository including the license, README file, Contributing file, Code of Conduct, and other documentation. After I read all those files, I found a resource where I could find open-source projects. Among those, I found that Open Source Friday is a good resource for open-source projects. The most important part is that the contribution must be meaningful to the project, and if we get a positive response, that means you have gained some level of experience. A positive response always encourages us to do more projects and help the tech community better their ways. One of my friends posted on Facebook that his PC fan had broken down and he did not know how to fix it. When I saw that message, I sent him a link to a website where we could buy a fan online or find instructions about how to fix his PC fan by himself. Sharing is love, and sharing gives us experience, and experience gives us confidence, and confidence leads to success, and success makes you happy.
