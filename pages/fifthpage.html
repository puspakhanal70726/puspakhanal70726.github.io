    SASS

    Today my topic is SASS, which means syntactically awesome style sheets. SASS is all about breaking things into small parts, which makes web developer life easy. SASS is processing that combines all the language into CSS, and in SASS, we can make each part of the section. Thus, if running code and then taking a break, we can easily go back and fix the problem in no time. Before, I had to write a long string code in the same class, but now, I can break the CSS into smaller groups that make our life easier.

    From today, I have understood SASS and how it functions. Using SASS is much easier and more efficient. First, I was confused, and I could not find how it worked, so I did some research on Google. After two weeks, I finally I discovered how it works. If anybody wants to practice SASS, I recommend the Code Academy as it is the best solution to practice and get the knowledge. There is only one way to become more familiar, and that is to practice until you become successful.
