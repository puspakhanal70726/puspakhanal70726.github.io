    Team Work
    </h3>
    <p>
      Working with the group was very helpful, and my team helped me a lot. Sometimes, if I could not figure things out, I talked to the group, and they helped me out. Pair programming is an excellent way to interact with a team. It is a good experience to use Github, SourceTree, and Git. Every time I write code, if I cannot find something, I place whatever I have done into a repository, and I send it for peer review. My group comments on what it should write, and I follow the directions. Working in a group is an excellent experience.

    <p>On the seventh day, I sent my code for peer review to my group, but I still needed to work on the drop-down menu. I worked a whole day on it, but I could not figure it out, so I talked to my group and asked if they could help.  They could not figure it out either. I talked to the professor, and she helped me out, and it finally works. However, I need to work on some minor details like testing it on the browser, code review, and Sass. When I showed my work to my group, they said I wrote too much code, and they helped me minimize it. Finally, it was time to submit it to the portal, and I did it.
