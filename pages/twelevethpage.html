    On the third day, I started working with CSS and Sass at the same time. It did not work out nicely, so I had to go back to Code Academy to practice again. I spent 2 hours practicing Sass and was still confused. It was very hard to catch up. On the third day, I completed almost 60 percent of my project, and I was still a bit behind. I started working with a drop-down menu, and it took me almost an hour to complete it. As soon as I completed the drop-down menu, the class was over, and I went home.

    On the fourth day, I finished almost 80 percent of my project, and I was excited to be nearly done. Before I went further, I had to send my code to a friend for a peer review. I got some comments on my project, and I still needed to fix some of the code. I did not know how to do that, so I asked my friend if he could help me out. And he helped me out, and I fixed it.

    On the fifth day, I started working with CSS and SASS. Finally, I have completed my project, and now I need to do a review before I send it to a friend for peer review. It took almost 1 hour to complete the peer review; I sent my code to the friend, and he commented that it looks good. This project is the longest project I ever did. It took five days to complete this project, and I need to manage several extra hours at home to finish it. It is a good experience learning how to work with HTML, CSS, SASS, GitHub, Source Tree, Trello, and Dashboard.
