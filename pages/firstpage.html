        GitHub
      </h3>
      <p>
        GitHub is a website created by a bunch of software engineers to communicate and share their ideas with other software engineers and create an environment where they can come up with the best solutions for changing technology. Leaning about the GitHub page is more difficult than when I first started, but when continually using it, it is not too hard to catch up. Whatever we do the first time, it will be difficult, but as we do it more and more, it gets better. Trying a new thing is hard, but after you become used to it, you feel enlightened. If you know something and someone asks you, do you know how to do it? After you say yes, then makes you feel proud, which gives you confidence. Confidence is not something you buy from the market. There is only one thing that makes you confident, and that is try and try until you become used to it. The best way to become confident is to have self-confidence, and a "you can do it" attitude. English is my second language, and I am still trying to learn it, which means if I can do it, you can also do it; this is simple logic.This week was tops, and I have caught on to everything possible. Technology never stays the same; it is changing and will always change. The changing of technology is directly connected with the nature of human beings. That is why technology will not stay the same; it is changing widely. Today the world is full of technology. If something happened to technology, human beings would remain backward. To maintain the technology, we need to have more software engineers so they can come up with the best solutions so we can use our technology forever and ever.
