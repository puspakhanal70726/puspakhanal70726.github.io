    JavaScript
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
    Today my job is JavaScript; It is harder to understand. If I can talk honestly, I really do not know how it works. I have only done simple JavaScript, but I know it would not work. I have learned more, and I'm working on it. I don't know how long it will take me to become more familiar with JavaScript. I know that nobody is perfect, and there is always someone who is more intelligent. I do not want to become perfect, and there no possible way for me to become that, but I can be good. I'm on my way, and I will get there some day. I will never give up unless I become good or used to the basics and some complex.

    <p class="paragraph">If anyone wants to practice JavaScript, I would recommend w3resource; this is the best resource to practice and explore knowledge. On this website, they separate the question with the answer according to simple practice questions, and the second part is complex with all of the solutions and how they work. They have different solutions for one question. That helps us to think about one problem in a different way or different solution. I know that learning new things always makes our lives complex, but thinking that it is hard and that we cannot figure out how it works or giving up is not the solution. Let me tell a short story. If you have problems in your life, you fix the problems. I know that there is a way, and it is same to find a way that works for you. There is a way that makes your life easier; you must keep practicing until you find the key.
