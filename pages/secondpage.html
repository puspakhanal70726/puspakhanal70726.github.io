    Responsive
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
    This week, I learned how to make a website responsive to another different device. Responsive web design includes making the website viewable on another different device and fit another device's shape and size. Users can view websites on different devices like desktops, tablets, and phones. I was curious, at the beginning of the semester, how I could make a website responsive to all the different devices that are used in the world. As the course goes along, it gets harder and harder, but life is all about trying. When one tries a new thing, one is not always successful the first time, but whoever tries and keeps trying will be successful one day. If you want to be successful, you need to keep trying. The more you try, the more familiar you become with the concept; the more you focus, the more you understand. That is how all people learn. At first, I did not understand how to work with responsive web design.

    When  my professor taught me, I understood only a little bit, but in the class, she gave the name of a website which helped me to learn responsive design fast and more easily. As soon as I got the information, I started to delve into that website; it took me several hours to figure out how to do it. When I went further into the lesson, I understood much more than before. If you want to learn how responsive web design works with other devices, I recommend www.w3school.com. W3school is the best guide if you want to learn how to build a website using CSS and HTML. Learning is never going to be easy, but try to make it feel easier. Everyone on earth has his or her own learning style. First, find what learning style is best for you and proceed that way. You will definitely find success. At last, I understand how responsive web design works.
