    Layout

    Learning layout is fun, and the best part of leaning layout is that the more I practice, the more I learn. Layout homework helps me to explore more advanced concepts so that I can create better layout. When I first started working with layout, I was confused about how I was going to start. After seeing my friend's layouts in the show and talking to them, I got a good concept of how I could start with my layout.  The best part of doing homework is getting a good concept about the content. Now that I have the concept, I can see that I also know how to work with layout.

      You should never be afraid when you are stuck, and you need to keep trying until you find the right solution. The more you break a code down, the more ways you will find to write that code. Learning new things is never easy; you need more practice with anything new, and the more you practice, the more confident you will become in the field.You must always break a problem down into smaller problems and never stop trying. The only way to become successful is through practice. The more you practice, the more you will understand, and the more you understand, the clearer matters will become. Always approach problems by reducing them to smaller ones. Once you find the smaller problems, you will see how they only make a big problem when you combine them
