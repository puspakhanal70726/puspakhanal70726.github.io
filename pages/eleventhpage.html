    How I monitor my Project?
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the first day, I planned on how I would use my project. I knew that planning was not easy, but if I tried, it would not be too hard to get there. First, I made a checklist of the minor details that I needed to cover. After I had done the checklist, I created a "to-do" list and showed it to my friend, who added more, but I didn't know how to use the SASS method, so I asked him to help me to figure out how to use it. He said that he would help me, and he explained it to me for 30 minutes, but I was still not fully confident; I just knew a little bit, but it was alright. Something was better than nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day, I first made the HTML and CSS directories, and I started working with the HTML. It took almost all of the hours in classes to completed the files. I also used some CSS files, with the basics. I used the GitHub page for the peer review. I got a comment on the HTML, and I needed to fix some spelling errors and attributes. It took 10-15 minutes to fix that comment because I had sent a giant HTML file for the peer review. After I finished fixing the comment, I started working on the CSS, and when the class was over, I packed my class materials and went home.
