    <h3>Continous</h3>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>The links style can be displayed depending on state they are using and what states they are in. There are four states are a normal, unvisited link; a link the user has visited; a link during mouseover; and a link the moment it is clicked. There is rules when setting the links. They are that hover must come after a link and visited and active must come after a hover.
    </p>
     <h3>Float</h3>
     <p> This property explains whether or not an element should float. The clear property is one to use to control the floating elements. The float property is used to wrap text around pictures. You can float the text right and left.
     </p>
     <h3>Animation</h3>
     <p>This property allows you to change the style of the elements. It also allows the use of CSS properties as many times as you wish. If you want to use CSS animation, you need to specify some key frames before use.
     </p>
     <h3>
     Transformation
   </h3>
      <p>This property allow users to translate, rotate, scale, and skew elements. Transformation allows elements to change shape, size, and position. Transformation CSS only supports 2D and 3D.
     </p>
     <h3>Text
      </h3>
      <p>This property explains whether you want to add clip content or scrollbars and when the content of an element fits a specified area. The text values are visible, hidden, scroll, and auto.
      </p>
      <h3>Dropdown</h3>
      <p> This property opens a box that is seen when the user moves the mouse over an element. There is a dropdown menu that goes from left to right, right to right. We can add a dropdown menu to a navigation bar.
      </p>
      <h3>Form</h3>
      <p> You can improve the look of the HTML form by using the CSS. If you want to use the width property that determines how much width you want to use for input field or want to style a specific input type, you need this input element, with select text fields, select password fields, or select number fields.
