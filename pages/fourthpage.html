    <h3>
    CSS
    </h3>
    <p>
    When I first saw CSS, it seemed too difficult. When anybody is new in the field, they have a lot of difficulties, which is natural. I was confused about the different CSS properties, such as what they do and what the benefits of using CSS properties are. My nine research proprieties are animation, background, border, color, dimension, font, text, transform, and visual formatting. After my research, I want to know and understand the CSS properties better and in an easier way so that I can explore them more efficiently.
    </p>
    <h3>
    Color
    </h3>
    <p>The color property explains how you want to use the color of the text. We can use any color as a background color, and a text color that makes it look beautiful and easy to read. Its function is decorating the text and the background color. CS's color value are used in Hexadecimal colors, RGB colors, RGBA colors, HSL colors, HSLA colors, and Predefined cross-browser color names.
    </p>
    <h3>
    Box Model
    </h3>
    <p>All HTML elements use boxes. When you talk about CSS, it means you're talking about design and layout. The value of the box model is content and padding, border, and margin. When you're working with CSS elements, it means you have set the width and height of the properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Font families</h3>
    <p>There are two types of font families. There are generic family and font family. A group of font family that look similar are Serif or Monospace. And some of the specific font family are Times New Roman or Arial. There are two font size values: absolute, or relative size.
    </p>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>The links style can be displayed depending on state they are using and what states they are in. There are four states are a normal, unvisited link; a link the user has visited; a link during mouseover; and a link the moment it is clicked. There is rules when setting the links. They are that hover must come after a link and visited and active must come after a hover.
    </p>
     <h3>Float</h3>
     <p> This property explains whether or not an element should float. The clear property is one to use to control the floating elements. The float property is used to wrap text around pictures. You can float the text right and left.
     </p>
     <h3>Animation</h3>
     <p>This property allows you to change the style of the elements. It also allows the use of CSS properties as many times as you wish. If you want to use CSS animation, you need to specify some key frames before use.
     </p>
     <h3>
     Transformation
   </h3>
      <p>This property allow users to translate, rotate, scale, and skew elements. Transformation allows elements to change shape, size, and position. Transformation CSS only supports 2D and 3D.
     </p>
     <h3>Text
      </h3>
      <p>This property explains whether you want to add clip content or scrollbars and when the content of an element fits a specified area. The text values are visible, hidden, scroll, and auto.
      </p>
      <h3>Dropdown</h3>
      <p> This property opens a box that is seen when the user moves the mouse over an element. There is a dropdown menu that goes from left to right, right to right. We can add a dropdown menu to a navigation bar.
      </p>
      <h3>Form</h3>
      <p> You can improve the look of the HTML form by using the CSS. If you want to use the width property that determines how much width you want to use for input field or want to style a specific input type, you need this input element, with select text fields, select password fields, or select number fields.
