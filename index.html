<p>Why not use more than one account on a window? If more than one person uses the same computer in the family, we should give different user accounts. If we use only one user account on a personal computer, everybody will use the same account with all the same files, settings, and application. If we have only one account, everyone accesses the same web pages. If we access the same web pages, we allow other people to use our online account if we stay logged in the account.
